# Learning Golang 

Prompting Claude

# 1  Prompt: Conceptual Understanding of Golang
I'm currently proficient in Python and want to learn Golang. Before diving into code:1. What are the key philosophical differences between Python and Golang?2. What problems was Go designed to solve?3. What mental models should I adjust coming from Python?4. What are common misconceptions developers have about Golang?

# 2 Prompt: Learning Key concepts
I want to understand these key concepts: Consts, Structs and Pointers in Golang. Could you break down: 1. How each concept is implemented in Golang 2. How it compares to Python  3. The key syntax and structures I need to understand 4. Common patterns and best practices
Let's not write complex code yet, just focus on structure and concepts.

# My Notes
Claude AI gave simple explanations with examples for each concept. It also explained every concept in comparison to Python.

# 2 Prompt: Testing Understanding with exercises
I want to understand Golang programming concepts, with examples. Kindly explain them to me and ask me questions that would test my understanding. Give me questions that I can apply coding. Remember I dont know the syntax

# My Notes
The AI was able to properly explain concepts in comparison with Python Concepts. It gave me a series of 15 Questions which tested my understanding of the 5 Lessons that included: Variables and Types, Functions, Control Structures, Arrays and Slices and Maps. After doing the exercises I submitted my answers and my understanding was graded with detailed explanations where my answers were wrong.


# 4 Prompt : Learning Through Teaching
I'm new to Golang and I've gotten a bit rusty in coding, and I'd like you to be my Golang tutor. Instead of giving direct answers, please help me learn by:
- Asking guiding questions that help me discover solutions
- Breaking down problems into smaller steps
- Giving hints when I'm stuck rather than complete solutions
- Encouraging me to explain my thinking
- Pointing out patterns and connections to previous concepts
- Helping me debug by asking me to examine my assumptions

# My Notes

# 5 Prompt:
I'm ready to implement my first Golang function. Could you guide me through creating a
'Student' function with name, ID, and grades? Please explain each part of the syntax,
especially the parts that differ from Python's approach to functions and methods.

# My Notes
I had to refine my prompt because it was not quite clear what exactly was to be performed. I refined it by adding some specific purpose such as calculating the avrage of the grades and printing  student info

#  Prompt: creating  comprehensive documentation 
Please create a comprehensive README.md file for my project based on the following information:
